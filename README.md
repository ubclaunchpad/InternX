# Internado [![Travis](https://travis-ci.com/ubclaunchpad/Internado.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ubclaunchpad/Internado)
Find personalized internship opportunities based on your skills and interests

## Todo (Not in order)
  * Docker
  * Travis CI
  * Skeleton for backend
  * Skeleton for frontend
  * Unit tests
  * Integration test
  * Eslint?
  * Simple scrapy application for single website
  * NoSQL and SQL database setup
  * User authentication

## User Stories
  1. As a university student, I want a personalized job board so that I can find relevant and interesting internships
  2. As a user I want to set notification for job postings based on specific criteria, so that I get notified about new opportunities and job posting deadline

## MVP
1. Database for storing user info and caching some internship opportunities
2. Scraping single website for a list of internships
3. User login (?)
4. Personalized internship suggestions based on users

## Stretch Goals
  1. Autogenerate personal websites based on users information
  2. Schedueling system to manage interviewe

## Non-Functional Requirements
  1. Handle large number of requests
  2. Perioritize job posting based on user interest and deadline


## Risks and Mitigation
  1. Algorithm for finding internships could be very complex
  2. Could be difficult to extend to more job sites due to different formatting


## Technology Stack (Options)
- Database: 
  - NoSQL, MySQL
- Web scraping: 
  - Scrappy Framework
- Backend
  - **Node.js**, Django
- Frontend
  - React Framework, Vue.js
